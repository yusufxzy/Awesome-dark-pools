# Dark Pools Reading List

I am putting this reading list together for anyone looking to dive into dark pools. 
Dark pools have been an essential component of traditional finance since the early 90s, providing venues for trading large blocks of securities away from the public eye. As of 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had registered 60 dark pools. These Traditional dark pools are run by trusted operators such as exchanges, like the NYSE or NASDAQ; some are broker-dealer-operated, like MS Pool by Morgan Stanley and SigmaX by Goldman Sachs; and some are independently operated, like Liquidnet or MatchNow.

While dark pools offer the advantage of privacy and minimizing market impact for large trades, they are not without controversy. The very operators trusted to run these pools have, on numerous occasions, been found guilty of abusing their privileged positions. Misconduct has included trading against their users, leading to a cumulative $340 million in fines imposed by the SEC for various infractions. These attacks have been continual despite of regulatory actions because the Profit from Corruption is far greater than the cost of corruption.

Blockchain-based dark pools, on the other hand, aim to abstract the need for trust in a single operator. Leveraging Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), these dark pools aim to ensure both pre-execution and post-execution privacy.
